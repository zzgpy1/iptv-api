Recommended to enable: although it increases speed test time, it more effectively distinguishes playable interfaces.      | True              |
| open_filter_speed      | Enable speed filtering. Interfaces below the minimum speed (`min_speed`) will be filtered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | True              |
| open_supply            | Enable compensation mechanism mode. When the number of channel interfaces is insufficient, interfaces that do not meet the conditions (such as lower than minimum speed) but may still be available will be added to the result to avoid empty results.                                                                                     | True              |

| speed_test_limit       | Number of interfaces to test at the same time. Controls concurrency in the speed test stage. Larger values shorten speed test time but increase load and may reduce accuracy; smaller values increase time but reduce load and improve accuracy.                                                                                            | 10                |
| speed_test_timeout     | Single interface speed test timeout duration in seconds. Larger values increase speed test time and number of interfaces obtained (but with lower average quality); smaller values reduce time and favor low-latency, higher-quality interfaces.                                                                                            | 10                |
| speed_test_filter_host | Use Host address to de-duplicate speed tests. Channels with the same Host share speed test data. Enabling this can greatly reduce speed test time but may cause inaccurate results.                                                                                                                                                         | False             |
| request_timeout        | Query request timeout duration in seconds, used to control timeout and retry duration when querying interface text links. Adjusting this value can optimize update time.                                                                                                                                                                    | 10                |

| location               | Interface location filter. Result will only contain interfaces whose location matches the given keywords (comma-separated). Leave empty to not restrict by location. Recommended to set near the end user to improve playback experience.                                                                                                   |                   |
| isp                    | Interface operator filter. Result will only contain interfaces whose operator matches the given keywords (comma-separated). Leave empty to not restrict by operator.                                                                                                                                                                        |                   |

be changed as needed), then run the following command in the path where the file is located:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### 2. Manual deployment with commands

##### (1) Pull the image

```bash
docker pull guovern/iptv-api:latest
```

🚀 Proxy acceleration (use this command if pulling fails, but it may download an older version):

```bash
docker pull docker.1ms.run/guovern/iptv-api:latest
```

##### (2) Run the container

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:8080 guovern/iptv-api
```

**Environment variables:**

| Variable        | Description                                                                                                      | Default   |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------|
| PUBLIC_DOMAIN   | Public domain or IP address, determines external access and the Host used in push stream results                 | 127.0.0.1 |
| PUBLIC_PORT     | Public port, set to the mapped port, determines external access address and the port used in push stream results | 80        |
| NGINX_HTTP_PORT | Nginx HTTP service port, needs to be mapped for external access                                                  | 8080      |

If you need to modify environment variables, add the following parameters after the above run command:

```bash
# Modify public domain
-e PUBLIC_DOMAIN=your.domain.com
# Modify public port
-e PUBLIC_PORT=80
```

In addition to the environment variables listed above, you can also override the [configuration items](#Config) in the
configuration file via environment variables.

**Mounts:** used to synchronize files between the host and the container. You can edit templates, configs, and access
generated result files directly on the host. Append the following options to the run command above:

```bash
# Mount config directory
-v /iptv-api/config:/iptv-api/config
# Mount output directory
-v /iptv-api/output:/iptv-api/output
```

**RTMP Streaming:**

> [!NOTE]
> 1. If deploying on a server, be sure to set the `PUBLIC_DOMAIN` environment variable to the server's domain name or IP
     address and the `PUBLIC_PORT` environment variable to the public port; otherwise the streaming addresses will not
     be accessible.
> 2. When streaming is enabled, obtained interfaces (e.g., subscription sources) will be streamed by default.
> 3. To stream local video sources, create an `hls` folder under the `config` directory and place video files named
     after the channel; the program will automatically stream them to the corresponding channels.

| Streaming Endpoint | Description                          |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| /hls               | hls streaming endpoint               |
