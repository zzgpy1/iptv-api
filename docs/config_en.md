| open_headers           | Enable using request header authentication information contained in M3U, used for speed test and other operations. Note: only a few players support playing such interfaces with authentication info, so it is disabled by default.                                                                                                                                  | False             |

| open_filter_resolution | Enable resolution filtering. Interfaces below the minimum resolution (`min_resolution`) will be filtered. GUI users need to manually install FFmpeg; the program will call FFmpeg to obtain interface resolution. Recommended to enable: although it increases speed test time, it more effectively distinguishes playable interfaces.                               | True              |
| open_filter_speed      | Enable speed filtering.

| open_supply            | Enable compensation mechanism mode. When the number of channel interfaces is insufficient, interfaces that do not meet the conditions (such as lower than minimum speed) but may still be available will be added to the result to avoid empty results.                                                                                                              | True              |

| max_resolution         | Maximum interface resolution, takes effect only when `open_filter_resolution` is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 1920x1080         |
| min_speed              | Minimum interface speed (unit: M/s), takes effect only when `open_filter_speed` is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 0.5               |
| speed_test_limit       | Number of interfaces to test at the same time. Controls concurrency in the speed test stage. Larger values shorten speed test time but increase load and may reduce accuracy; smaller values increase time but reduce load and improve accuracy.                                                                                                                     | 10                |
| speed_test_timeout     | Single interface speed test timeout duration in seconds. Larger values increase speed test time and number of interfaces obtained (but with lower average quality); smaller values reduce time and favor low-latency, higher-quality interfaces.                                                                                                                     | 10                |
| speed_test_filter_host | Use Host address to de-duplicate speed tests. Channels with the same Host share speed test data. Enabling this can greatly reduce speed test time but may cause inaccurate results.                                                                                                                                                                                  | False             |
| request_timeout        | Query request timeout duration in seconds, used to control timeout and retry duration when querying interface text links. Adjusting this value can optimize update time.                                                                                                                                                                                             | 10                |
| recent_days            | Retrieve interfaces updated within the recent time range (in days). Reducing this appropriately can avoid matching issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 30                |
