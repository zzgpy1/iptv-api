| open_supply            | Enable compensation mechanism mode. When the number of channel interfaces is insufficient, interfaces that do not meet the conditions (such as lower than minimum speed) but may still be available will be added to the result to avoid empty results.                                                                                     | True              |
| min_resolution         | Minimum interface resolution, takes effect only when `open_filter_resolution` is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1920x1080         |
| max_resolution         | Maximum interface resolution, takes effect only when `open_filter_resolution` is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 1920x1080         |
| min_speed              | Minimum interface speed (unit: M/s), takes effect only when `open_filter_speed` is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 0.5               |
| speed_test_limit       | Number of interfaces to test at the same time. Controls concurrency in the speed test stage. Larger values shorten speed test time but increase load and may reduce accuracy; smaller values increase time but reduce load and improve accuracy.                                                                                            | 10                |
| speed_test_timeout     | Single interface speed test timeout duration in seconds. Larger values increase speed test time and number of interfaces obtained (but with lower average quality); smaller values reduce time and favor low-latency, higher-quality interfaces.                                                                                            | 10                |
| speed_test_filter_host | Use Host address to de-duplicate speed tests. Channels with the same Host share speed test data. Enabling this can greatly reduce speed test time but may cause inaccurate results.                                                                                                                                                         | False             |
| request_timeout        | Query request timeout duration in seconds, used to control timeout and retry duration when querying interface text links. Adjusting this value can optimize update time.                                                                                                                                                                    | 10                |

| ipv_type               | Protocol type of interfaces in the generated result. Optional values: `ipv4`, `ipv6`, `all`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | all               |
| ipv_type_prefer        | Interface protocol type preference. Preferred type will be ordered earlier in the result. Optional values: `ipv4`, `ipv6`, `auto`.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | auto              |
| location               | Interface location filter. Result will only contain interfaces whose location matches the given keywords (comma-separated). Leave empty to not restrict by location. Recommended to set near the end user to improve playback experience.                                                                                                   |                   |
| isp                    | Interface operator filter. Result will only contain interfaces whose operator matches the given keywords (comma-separated). Leave empty to not restrict by operator.                                                                                                                                                                        |                   |
| origin_type_prefer     | Preferred interface source ordering. The result is sorted in this order (comma-separated). Example: `local,subscribe`. Leave empty to not specify and sort by interface speed instead.                                                                                                                                                      |                   |

| rtmp_idle_timeout      | RTMP channel idle stop-streaming timeout in seconds. When no one watches for longer than this duration, streaming is stopped, helping reduce server resource usage.                                                                                                                                                                         | 300               |
| rtmp_max_streams       | Maximum number of concurrent RTMP push streams. Controls how many channels can be pushed at the same time. Larger values increase server load; tune to optimize resource usage.                                                                                                                                                             | 10                |
