## Workflow deployment

Use GitHub Actions workflows to deploy and manually trigger the update endpoint.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because GitHub resources are limited, workflow updates can only be triggered manually.
> If you need frequent updates or scheduled runs, please deploy using another method.

### Enter the IPTV-API Project

Open https://github.com/Guovin/iptv-api and click `Star` to favorite this project (Your Star is my motivation for
continuous updates).
![Star](./images/star.png 'Star')

### Fork

Copy the source code of this repository to your personal account repository.
![Fork button](./images/fork-btn.png 'Fork button')

1. Name your personal repository as you like (the final live source result link depends on this name), here we use the
   default `iptv-api` as an example.
2. Confirm the information is correct and click to create.

![Fork details](./images/fork-detail.png 'Fork details')

### Update Source Code

Since this project will continue to iterate and optimize, if you want to get the latest updates, you can do the
following:

> [!WARNING]
> If you only want to update your fork, do not click `Contribute` or `Open pull request` to create a PR.
> Go to your own repository and use `Sync fork` → `Update branch`.
> If a synchronization conflict occurs, use `Discard commits` as described below.
> Create a Pull Request only when you intentionally want to contribute code to the upstream repository.

#### 1. Watch

Follow this project, and subsequent update logs will be released as `releases`, and you will receive email
notifications.
![Watch All Activity](./images/watch-activity.png 'Watch All Activity')

#### 2. Sync fork

- Normal update:

Go back to the homepage of your forked repository, if there are updates, click `Sync fork`, `Update branch` to confirm
and update the latest code.
![Sync fork](./images/sync-fork.png 'Sync fork')

- No `Update branch` button, update conflict:

This is because some files conflict with the default files of the main repository, click `Discard commits` to update the
latest code.
![Conflict resolution](./images/conflict.png 'Conflict resolution')

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid conflicts when updating the code later, it is recommended to copy files in the `config` directory and rename
> them by adding the `user_` prefix before modifying.

### Modify Template

When you click to confirm creation in step one, you will automatically jump to your personal repository after success.
At this time, your personal repository has been created, and you can customize your live source channel menu!

#### 1. Click the demo.txt template file in the config folder:

![config folder entry](./images/config-folder.png 'config folder entry')

![demo.txt entry](./images/demo-btn.png 'demo.txt entry')

You can copy and refer to the format of the default template for subsequent operations.

#### 2. Create a personal template user_demo.txt in the config folder:

1. Click the `config` directory.
2. Create a file.
3. Name the template file `user_demo.txt`.
4. The template file needs to be written in the format of (channel category, #genre#), (channel name, channel interface)
   with a comma. If you want to whitelist the interface (no speed test, keep it at the top of the result), you can add
   `$!` after the address, such as http://xxx$!. You can also add additional information, such as: http://xxx$!
   whitelist.
5. Click `Commit changes...` to save.

![Create user_demo.txt](./images/edit-user-demo.png 'Create user_demo.txt')

### Modify Configuration

Like editing templates, modify the runtime configuration.

#### 1. Click the config.ini configuration file in the config folder:

![config.ini entry](./images/config-btn.png 'config.ini entry')

#### 2. Copy the default configuration file content:

![copy config.ini](./images/copy-config.png 'Copy default configuration')

#### 3. Create a personal configuration file user_config.ini in the config folder:

1. Create a file.
2. Name the configuration file `user_config.ini`.
3. Paste the default configuration. When creating `user_config.ini`, enter only the configuration items you want to
   modify; you do not need to copy the entire `config.ini`.
4. Modify the template and result file configuration and CDN proxy acceleration (recommended):
    - source_file = config/user_demo.txt
    - final_file = output/user_result.txt
    - cdn_url = (go to the `Govin` public account and reply `cdn` to get it)
5. Click `Commit changes...` to save.

![Create user_config.ini](./images/edit-user-config.png 'Create user_config.ini')
![Edit final_file configuration](./images/edit-user-final-file.png 'Edit final_file configuration')
![Edit source_file configuration](./images/edit-user-source-file.png 'Edit source_file configuration')

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep `[Settings]` at the top of `user_config.ini`; otherwise, the custom configuration below does not take effect.

Adjust the configuration as needed, here is the default configuration description:
[Configuration parameters](./config_en.md)

> [!NOTE]
> 1. Some players, such as `PotPlayer`, cannot parse supplementary interface information. Set `open_url_info = False` (GUI: clear “Display interface information”) if this prevents playback.
> 2. If your network supports IPv6, set `ipv6_support = True` (GUI: select “Force assume the current network supports IPv6”) to skip detection.
> 3. For playback/speed-test request headers, configure the global `user_agent` or append `UA=value` to a URL in `config/subscribe.txt`. The UA is written to `.m3u` results without requiring `open_headers`.
> 4. `location` and `isp` filter out non-matching interfaces by default. With `open_supply = True`, they are retained as lower-priority fallbacks.
> 5. Use `sort_by` with comma-separated `speed`, `delay`, and `resolution` values. For example, `resolution,speed` sorts by resolution and then speed.

#### Add data sources and more

**Subscription sources (`config/subscribe.txt`)**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project provides no default subscription addresses. Add your own; otherwise, update results may be empty.

Both `.txt` and `.m3u` URLs are supported as subscriptions, and the program reads channel interface entries from them
sequentially.
![Subscription sources](./images/subscribe.png 'Subscription sources')

If a subscription source requires a specific `User-Agent` to be accessed, append `UA=value` after the subscription URL
(wrap it in quotes when it contains spaces), for example:

```text
https://example.com/sub.m3u UA=okHttp/Mod-1.5.0.0
https://example.com/sub2.m3u UA="Mozilla/5.0 xxx"
```

This `UA` is used for: fetching the subscription content, speed testing the interfaces under that subscription, and
writing into the `.m3u` result (for players) — no need to enable `open_headers`. If you want to apply one UA to all
interfaces (instead of adding it one by one), set the global `user_agent` in the configuration. Priority: interface's
own UA (`#EXTVLCOPT` embedded in m3u) > subscription URL UA > global `user_agent` > built-in default UA. Note: request
headers can only be written into the `.m3u` result; the `.txt` format cannot carry a UA.


- Local sources（`config/local.txt`）

  Channel interface data comes from local files. If there are multiple local source files, you can create a `local`
  directory under `config` to store them; the program will read the channel interface data from them in order. Supports
  `txt` and `m3u` files.


- Logo source (`config/logo`)

  Directory for channel logo images. The program will match corresponding logo images in this directory based on the
  channel names in the template. If a remote library `logo_url` is used, the remote source will be preferred.


- EPG Source (`config/epg.txt`)

  The source of program guide information. The program will sequentially fetch the program guide data from the
  subscription addresses in the file and aggregate the output.


- Channel Aliases (`config/alias.txt`)

  A list of aliases for channel names, used to map multiple names to a single name when fetching from the interface,
  improving the fetch volume and accuracy. Format: TemplateChannelName,Alias1,Alias2,Alias3


- Blacklist (`config/blacklist.txt`)

  Interfaces that match the blacklist keywords will be filtered and not collected, such as low-quality interfaces with
  ads.


- Whitelist (`config/whitelist.txt`)

  Interfaces or subscription sources in the whitelist will not participate in speed testing and will be prioritized at
  the top of the results. Fill in the channel name to directly retain the record in the final result, such as: CCTV-1,
  interface address, only filling in the interface address will apply to all channels, multiple records are entered on
  separate lines.

> [!TIP]
> If a run produces no channel data, the logs distinguish between missing sources, empty subscription responses,
> unmatched channels, and results removed by filters. In the GUI, use “Configure sources” on the dashboard. Docker users
> should verify that `/iptv-api/config/subscribe.txt` inside the container is not empty.

### Run Update

If your template and configuration modifications are correct, you can configure `Actions` to achieve automatic updates.

#### 1. Enter Actions:

![Actions entry](./images/actions-btn.png 'Actions entry')

#### 2. Enable Actions workflow:

![Enable Actions workflow](./images/actions-enable.png 'Enable Actions workflow')
Since the Actions workflow of the forked repository is disabled by default, you need to manually confirm to enable it,
click the button in the red box to confirm enabling.
![Actions workflow enabled successfully](./images/actions-home.png 'Actions workflow enabled successfully')
After enabling successfully, you can see that there are no workflows running currently, don't worry, let's start running
your first update workflow below.

#### 3. Run the update workflow:

##### (1) Enable update schedule:

1. Click `update schedule` under the `Workflows` category.
2. Since the workflow of the forked repository is disabled by default, click the `Enable workflow` button to confirm the
   activation.

![Enable Workflows update](./images/workflows-btn.png 'Enable Workflows update')

##### (2) Run the Workflow based on branches:

Now you can run the update workflow.

1. Click `Run workflow`.
2. Here you can switch to the branch you want to run. Since the fork defaults to the `master` branch, if the template
   and configuration you modified are also in the `master` branch, just choose `master` here, and click `Run workflow`
   to confirm the run.

![Run Workflow](./images/workflows-run.png 'Run Workflow')

##### (3) Workflow in progress:

Wait a moment, and you will see that your first update workflow is running!
> [!NOTE]\
> The running time depends on the number of channels and pages in your template and other configurations, and also
> largely depends on the current network conditions. Please be patient. The default template and configuration usually
> take about 15 minutes.

![Workflow in progress](./images/workflow-running.png 'Workflow in progress')

##### (4) Cancel the running Workflow:

If you feel that this update is not quite right and you need to modify the template or configuration before running
again, you can click `Cancel run` to cancel this run.
![Cancel running Workflow](./images/workflow-cancel.png 'Cancel running Workflow')

##### (5) Workflow executed successfully:

If everything is normal, after a short wait, you will see that the workflow has been executed successfully (green check
mark).
![Workflow executed successfully](./images/workflow-success.png 'Workflow executed successfully')

At this point, you can visit the file link to see if the latest results have been synchronized:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-github-username/repository-name/master/output/user_result.txt

Recommended CDN-accelerated URL:
{cdn_url}/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-github-username/repository-name/master/output/user_result.txt

![Username and Repository Name](./images/rep-info.png 'Username and Repository Name')

If you can access this link and it returns the updated interface content, then your live source interface link has been
successfully created! Simply copy and paste this link into software like `TVBox` in the configuration field to use~

> [!NOTE]\
> If you have modified the template or configuration files and want to execute the update immediately, you can manually
> trigger (2)`Run workflow`.

## Command Line

1. Install Python
   Please download and install Python from the official website, and select the option to add Python to the system
   environment variable Path during installation.

2. Run the update
   Open the terminal CMD in the project directory and run the following commands in sequence:

Install dependencies:

```shell
pip install pipenv
```

```shell
pipenv install --dev
```

Start the update:

```shell
pipenv run dev
```

Start the service:

```shell
pipenv run service
```

## GUI Software

The desktop GUI for Windows and macOS provides one-click updates, live progress, channel and result management, retesting, RTMP monitoring, source configuration, and task history. Docker deployments use web result pages and do not include this desktop interface.

    </picture>
  </details>
</div>

Install dependencies and start it from the project directory:

```shell
pipenv install --dev
pipenv run ui
```

Build the desktop application for the current platform:

```shell
pipenv run ui_build
```

Settings are saved to `config/user_config.ini`; generated results, channel snapshots, task history, and logs are stored under `output/`. A packaged application places these directories in the operating system's application data directory on first launch. Install FFmpeg before enabling resolution probing. The Windows package can include nginx-rtmp. On macOS, install an nginx build with the RTMP module; the app generates and starts an isolated configuration automatically, while `IPTV_API_NGINX_PATH` and `IPTV_API_NGINX_RTMP_MODULE` can override discovery.

> [!WARNING]
> The legacy Tkinter interface is deprecated, retained temporarily for existing users, and scheduled for removal in a future release. It no longer receives maintenance, bug fixes, or new features. During the transition, start it with `pipenv run legacy_ui` or package it with `pipenv run legacy_ui_build`.

## Docker

### 1. Deployment with Compose

Download the [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) or create one by copying the content (internal parameters can
be changed as needed), then run the following command in the path where the file is located:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Manual deployment with commands

#### (1) Pull the image

```bash
docker pull guovern/iptv-api:latest
```

> [!CAUTION]
> If the official image cannot be pulled, use the following proxy; it may provide an older image version.

```bash
docker pull docker.1ms.run/guovern/iptv-api:latest
```

#### (2) Run the container

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:8080 guovern/iptv-api
```

**Environment variables:**

| Variable        | Description                                                                                         | Default   |
|:----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------|
| PUBLIC_URL      | Recommended complete public URL, such as `http://192.168.1.10` or `https://iptv.example.com`         |           |
| PUBLIC_DOMAIN   | Compatibility setting: public domain or IP used when `PUBLIC_URL` is empty                           | 127.0.0.1 |
| PUBLIC_PORT     | Compatibility setting: mapped host port used when `PUBLIC_URL` is empty                              | 80        |
| NGINX_HTTP_PORT | Advanced compatibility setting: internal container HTTP port; normally keep the default              | 8080      |

> [!NOTE]
> When IPv6 is enabled on the host/Docker, the container automatically listens on IPv6 addresses as well, with no extra configuration; in IPv4-only or IPv6-disabled environments it is skipped automatically.

If you need to modify environment variables, add the following parameters after the above run command:

```bash
# Recommended: set the complete public URL
-e PUBLIC_URL=https://iptv.example.com
```

With the repository Compose file, change only the host port through `PORT`, for example
`PORT=8088 docker compose up -d`.
An unset or empty `PUBLIC_URL` does not override `public_url` in the mounted configuration.

In addition to the environment variables listed above, you can also override
the [configuration items](../docs/config_en.md) in the configuration file via environment variables.

**Mounts:** used to synchronize files between the host and the container. You can edit templates, configs, and access
generated result files directly on the host. Append the following options to the run command above:

```bash
# Mount config directory
-v /iptv-api/config:/iptv-api/config
# Mount output directory
-v /iptv-api/output:/iptv-api/output
```

**RTMP Streaming:**

> [!WARNING]
> Enabling streaming relays obtained interfaces such as subscription sources by default. Use this only for content you own, are authorized to redistribute, or need for closed/internal testing. In Mainland China, ensure content authorization, copyright, network-audiovisual, and broadcasting requirements are met; do not distribute, relay, or publicly expose unauthorized live streams or program sources.

For server deployments, set the complete public address through `PUBLIC_URL`; legacy `PUBLIC_DOMAIN` and `PUBLIC_PORT` remain supported. To stream local videos, create `config/hls` and place files named after their channels in it; the program streams them to the corresponding channels.

| Streaming Endpoint | Description                          |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------|
| /hls               | hls streaming endpoint               |
| /hls/txt           | hls txt streaming endpoint           |
| /hls/m3u           | hls m3u streaming endpoint           |
| /hls/ipv4          | hls ipv4 default streaming endpoint  |
| /hls/ipv6          | hls ipv6 default streaming endpoint  |
| /hls/ipv4/txt      | hls ipv4 txt streaming endpoint      |
| /hls/ipv4/m3u      | hls ipv4 m3u streaming endpoint      |
| /hls/ipv6/txt      | hls ipv6 txt streaming endpoint      |
| /hls/ipv6/m3u      | hls ipv6 m3u streaming endpoint      |
| /stat              | Streaming status statistics endpoint |

### Streaming Usage Tutorial

Docker enables streaming with minimal configuration and placing local video files in the right folder. Below are two
common streaming scenarios: subscription (online) sources and local video files.

> [!WARNING]
> Use this only for content you are authorized to relay or for closed/internal technical testing.

#### 1. Preparations before start (Docker Compose example)

- Use the repository's `docker-compose.yml` and confirm the following environment variables before starting:
    - `PORT`: user-facing port mapped on the host.
    - `PUBLIC_URL`: recommended complete public URL used to generate streaming and playlist links.
    - `NGINX_HTTP_PORT`: advanced compatibility setting; normally keep the internal container port unchanged.
- Make sure the `config` directory is mounted into the container (default `/iptv-api/config`) so you can edit templates,
  add local videos, and place subscription files on the host.

Example (excerpt from compose for reference):

```yml
services:
  iptv-api:
    image: guovern/iptv-api:latest
    container_name: iptv-api
    restart: unless-stopped

    ports:
      - "${PORT:-80}:8080" # PORT is user-facing; 8080 is the fixed internal container port

    volumes:
      - /iptv-api/config:/iptv-api/config # Change to host configuration folder path:container configuration folder path
      - /iptv-api/output:/iptv-api/output

    environment:
      PUBLIC_URL: "${PUBLIC_URL:-http://192.168.1.95}" # Change to the complete public URL
      PUBLIC_PORT: "${PORT:-80}" # Legacy compatibility value synchronized from PORT
      NGINX_HTTP_PORT: "8080" # Advanced compatibility setting; normally do not change
      CDN_URL: ""
      HTTP_PROXY: ""
```

#### 2. Subscription source streaming (online sources)

- Add subscription URLs (txt or m3u) to `config/subscribe.txt`. On startup the program will read the subscriptions and
  publish streams for the channels found.
- Streaming endpoints to view streamed channels:
    - `/hls/txt`, `/hls/m3u` (and their ipv4/ipv6 variants)

#### 3. Local video streaming (server video files)

- Create an `hls` folder under the mounted `config` directory (for example `/iptv-api/config/hls` on the host).
- Put video files named exactly as the channel titles used in your template (e.g., `海洋.mp4`). The program will
  automatically stream the corresponding file for that channel.

Example layout:

```
iptv-api/
├── config
│   └── hls
│       └── 海洋.mp4
```

- Add the channel in `config/demo.txt` (or your template) as usual; the program will map the local file to the channel
  and stream it.

Example template fragment:

```markdown
📺Main channels,#genre#
CCTV-1

📡Satellite,#genre#
Guangdong Satellite

🚀Local video,#genre#
海洋
```

#### 4. Start and verify

- Start the service (example using Compose):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Verify:
    - Check startup logs for successful initialization.
    - View streaming results (txt): visit `/hls/txt` to see current stream addresses and descriptions.
    - Use `/hls/m3u` to load the playlist into a player or `/hls/txt` for a plain list.

#### 5. Monitoring and logs

- Use the `/stat` endpoint to see current streaming counts, traffic, and basic statistics.
- Container logs provide detailed stream start/stop messages:
    - Logs show when a channel starts streaming and when idle channels stop.

#### 6. Common tips and tuning

- Public access & firewall: Make sure the HTTP port in `PUBLIC_URL` and the RTMP port are externally accessible through
  firewalls and cloud security groups.
- Domain and certificates: For HTTPS, set `PUBLIC_URL` directly to `https://your-domain` and manage TLS through an
  external reverse proxy or your hosting setup.
- Performance & concurrency: Local streaming consumes CPU and bandwidth. Adjust `rtmp_max_streams` to limit concurrent
  streams and avoid overloading the server.
- Idle stop: `rtmp_idle_timeout` controls how long a stream stays active with no viewers (in seconds); tune it per your
  needs.

#### 7. Useful RTMP-related configuration options

```ini
# RTMP channel idle stop timeout (seconds)
rtmp_idle_timeout = 300
# Maximum concurrent RTMP streams to avoid excessive server load
rtmp_max_streams = 10
```

Above is a compact guide to using streaming. Adjust configuration and verify using `/hls/*` and `/stat` endpoints to
confirm streaming availability and status.
